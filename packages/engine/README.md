# Videotape engine core (headless)

The first piece of the v2 engine ([05-design-v2.md](../../docs/05-design-v2.md) §5): it plays a
Python app's journeys and documents through the app protocol, with no composer, no rendering, no
scene state, and no clients. It covers experiments E5 and E10 (05 §15).

```bash
npx -y pnpm@9.15.0 install
npx -y pnpm@9.15.0 --filter @videotape/engine test
```

## Intent

`loadIntent(json)` reads the intent document the SDK produces (`videotape intent module:app`),
validates it against the schema the Python SDK publishes
([`intent.schema.json`](../../sdk/python/src/videotape/intent.schema.json), read from the SDK's
tree so the two cannot drift), and resolves every name the runtime looks up: tapes, frames,
handlers, loaders, records, hub destinations, and `under`. The engine never trusts its input to
have passed `videotape check`. `Records` validates documents, fields, and list items against the
records' JSON Schemas (Ajv, draft 2020-12) and keys the record items of lists.

The tests read intents generated from the SDK's sample apps (`test/fixtures/*.intent.json`);
`npx -y pnpm@9.15.0 --filter @videotape/engine intents` regenerates them, and a test fails when
they are out of date.
